## Description

Oh-My-Gift is a "find a gift" application that assist Users to find the perfect gift for that special someone for that special something. The User is first presented with a dynamic home page where they will be able to select who the gift is for, what category would they like the gift to be as well as a price range. As they select the options they will be presented with a list from which they can choose from. If they make a mistake, NO NEED TO WORRY simply click from the 3 options to go back to a specific section or just return to main menu. As a User selects the data is stored into local storage where the information is collected for the specific query from a Walmart Product List database.
